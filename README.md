## Introduction
Skater XL Virtual Assistant is a powerful tool designed to enhance the Skater XL modding experience. It provides users with an interactive chatbot interface for obtaining information, assistance, and support related to Skater XL modding. This project is currently in its early beta stage but aims to streamline modding tasks and provide valuable guidance to the Skater XL community.

## Goals
Our primary goals for the Skater XL Virtual Assistant project include:

- **Enhanced Modding Assistance**: We are developing a chatbot-based interface that enables users to get answers to their questions, access tutorials, and receive assistance with Skater XL modding tasks.

- **Integration with Skater XL Mod Docs Website**: The Virtual Assistant will seamlessly integrate with our Skater XL mod documentation website, ensuring easy access to resources and information.

## Technologies Used
Our Skater XL Virtual Assistant leverages the following technologies:

- **SvelteKit**: The front-end of the Virtual Assistant is built using SvelteKit, a modern web framework that provides efficient and responsive user interfaces.

- **Dialogflow**: Dialogflow powers the chatbot functionality, enabling natural language understanding and interaction with users. It allows for conversational interactions, making it easier for users to get the help they need.

- **JavaScript/HTML/CSS**: Standard web technologies are used to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

Please note that this project is an ongoing effort, and we welcome feedback from the Skater XL modding community to make improvements and enhance the modding experience with our Virtual Assistant.
